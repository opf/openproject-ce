    # In the olden times (pre 4.1) files were all saved under the configured storage path,
    # most likely `files`, with a timestamp attached to their name to avoid conflicts.
    #
    # e.g. `files/140917231758_openshift-setup.txt`
    #
    # The new approach is using CarrierWave for attachments. There the files will be stored
    # some place else. Where is not material for this migration.
    # It could be another directory or S3.
    #
    # The migration does the following:
    #
    # * rename the legacy files - it strips off the timestamps
    # * assign the renamed file to the CarrierWave uploader - this moves the file to
    #   the new location
    #
    # The rollback does the opposite using the remaining legacy column `disk_filename`
    # of Attachment. Meaning it adds the timestamp again and puts the files back into
    # the configured attachment storage path.
    #
    # This assumes that the attachment storage path is the same as before the migration
    # to CarrierWave and also that the legacy columns `filename` and `disk_filename`
    # are still present.
